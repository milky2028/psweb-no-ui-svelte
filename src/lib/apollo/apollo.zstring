Often used to render wide gamut source images, where preserving the relationship of colors inside and outside the destination gamut is more important than exactly matching the colors inside the destination gamut."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Intent/RelColor=Relative Colorimetric:  Attempts to match the media-relative Lab coordinates of the destination colors to the media-relative Lab coordinates of the source colors.  The source white point is mapped to the destination white point.  Recommended for most color conversions, especially when most source colors are already inside the destination gamut."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Intent/Saturation=Saturation:  Requests a highly saturated rendering, at the possible expense of color accuracy.  Mostly used for business graphics (pie charts, etc.), where color accuracy is less important than having a highly saturated result."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/LabeledProfileTemplate=^0:  ^1"
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/MapBlack=Use Black Point Compensation:  Controls whether to adjust for differences in black points when converting colors between color spaces.  When enabled, the full dynamic range of the source space is mapped into the full dynamic range of the destination space.  When disabled, the dynamic range of the source space is simulated in the destination space (which can result in blocked or gray shadows)."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Message=Description:  Move the cursor over the item you want described.  If you want to change the description for the current color settings, press the ^[Save...^] button."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Policies=Color Management Policies:  Policies specify how you want colors in a particular color model managed.  Policies handle the reading and embedding of color profiles, mismatches between embedded color profiles and the working space, and the moving of colors from one document to another."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Policy/Convert=Convert to Working Space:  Converts a newly opened document to the current working space if that document^}s embedded color profile does not match the working space.  When importing colors into a document, color appearance takes precedence over the numeric values of the colors."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Policy/Off=Off:  Turns off color management for newly created documents and for newly opened documents that have embedded color profiles different from the current working space.  If a newly opened document^}s embedded color profile matches the current working space, that profile is preserved.  When importing colors into a document, the numeric values of the colors take precedence over the color appearance."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Policy/Preserve=Preserve Embedded Profiles:  Preserves the embedded color profile in a newly opened document even if the color profile does not match the current working space.  When importing colors into an RGB or grayscale document, color appearance takes precedence over the numeric values of the colors.  When importing colors into a CMYK document, numeric values take precedence over the appearance."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Preset=^1:  ^2"
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/ProfileMismatches=Profile Mismatches:  Specifies when you want to be notified about profile mismatches."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/SuiteColorSyncInBridge=To synchronize color settings among your Creative Cloud applications, select Color Settings in Bridge."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/TextBlendGamma=Blend Text Colors Using Gamma:  Controls the blending behavior of text layers.  When enabled, text colors are blended using the specified gamma."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working=Working Spaces:  The working space specifies the working color profile for each color model.  (A color profile defines how a color^}s numeric values map to its visual appearance.)  The working space is used for documents that are not color-managed, and for newly created documents that are color-managed."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working/AdobeRGB1998=Adobe RGB (1998):  Provides a fairly large gamut (range) of RGB colors and is well-suited for documents that will be converted to CMYK.  Use this space if you need to do print production work with a broad range of colors."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working/AppleRGB=Apple RGB:  Reflects the characteristics of older Apple CRT displays using Gamma 1.8.  Use this space for files that you plan to display on older Mac OS systems, or for working with legacy (older) desktop publishing files."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working/ColorMatchRGB=ColorMatch RGB:  Matches the native color space of Radius Pressview monitors.  This space provides a smaller gamut alternative to Adobe RGB (1998) for print production work."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working/DotGain10=Dot Gain 10%:  Uses a space that reflects a dot gain of 10%."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working/DotGain15=Dot Gain 15%:  Uses a space that reflects a dot gain of 15%."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working/DotGain20=Dot Gain 20%:  Uses a space that reflects a dot gain of 20%."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working/DotGain25=Dot Gain 25%:  Uses a space that reflects a dot gain of 25%."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working/DotGain30=Dot Gain 30%:  Uses a space that reflects a dot gain of 30%."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working/Gamma18=Gray Gamma 1.8:  Uses the grayscale equivalent of a monitor gamma of 1.8, the default for legacy Macintosh computers.  The gamma setting of your monitor defines the brightness of the midtones."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working/Gamma22=Gray Gamma 2.2:  Uses the grayscale equivalent of a monitor gamma of 2.2, the default for Windows computers.  The gamma setting of your monitor defines the brightness of the midtones."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working/MonitorRGB=Monitor RGB:  Sets the RGB working space to your current monitor space.  This setting causes Photoshop to behave as if color management were turned off.  Use this setting if other applications in your workflow do not support color management."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working/ProPhoto=Provides a very large RGB gamut that encompasses the entire range of photographic materials. This is a color space particularly suited for output devices such as digital dye sub and inkjet photo printers, and for applications such as HiFi color. ProPhoto RGB is also called ^[ROMM RGB^] (see www.pima.net)."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/Working/sRGB=sRGB IEC61966-2.1:  Reflects the characteristics of the average CRT display.  This standard space is endorsed by many hardware and software manufacturers, and is becoming the default color space for many scanners, low-end printers, and software applications.  Ideal space for Web work, but not recommended for prepress work (because of its limited color gamut)."
"$$$/ColorSettings/Message/WorkingCMYK=Working CMYK:  Specifies the working CMYK profile."
